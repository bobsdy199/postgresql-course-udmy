# postgresql-course-udmy
Hi guys! Here I present what I have learned about PostgreSQL when I took the course on Udemy. Both .sql and dataset files are attached here, please have a look!

I also do some practices mostly everyday in [StrataScratch](https://platform.stratascratch.com/user/bob123) (please have a look at my profile!) to improve my skill since the website provide a higher difficulty levels of SQL.
